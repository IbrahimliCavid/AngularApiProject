## Description
AngularApiProject is a personal learning project aimed at mastering Angular and related technologies. It serves as a hands-on exercise to gain practical experience with modern tools and best practices. The backend is developed using C# (.NET Core) and PostgreSQL, following the Onion Architecture pattern, while the frontend is built with Angular.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Angular**
